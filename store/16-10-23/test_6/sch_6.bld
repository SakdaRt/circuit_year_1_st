WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "P82" LOC = P82;> [sch_6.ucf(5)]:
   This constraint cannot be distributed from the design objects matching 'NET
   "P82"' because those design objects do not contain or drive any instances of
   the correct type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "P82" LOC = P82;> [sch_6.ucf(5)]' could not be found and so the Locate
   constraint will be removed.

ERROR:ConstraintSystem:59 - Constraint <NET "P95" LOC = P95;> [sch_6.ucf(6)]:
   NET "P95" not found.  Please verify that:
   1. The specified design element actually exists in the original design.
   2. The specified object is spelled correctly in the constraint source file.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "P95" LOC = P95;> [sch_6.ucf(6)]' could not be found and so the Locate
   constraint will be removed.
